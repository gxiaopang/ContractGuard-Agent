"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — skills load on the right messages, and only those.

A skill is chosen by keyword overlap (waku/memory/procedural/loader.py): it
loads when a message shares 2+ words of 3+ letters with its name +
description, at most two per turn, highest overlap first. Review of two skill
PRs (#149, #159) found the two ways that goes wrong:

  1. Precision. A description built on question words (why, what, should,
     for) matches almost any message. "why did Alex move our meeting" loaded
     a metric-anomaly skill, and 28 lines of Shapley decomposition rode along.
  2. Hijacking. A new skill ties an existing one on shared words, and the tie
     goes to folder order, not relevance — so "prep me for tomorrow's standup"
     loaded interview-prep ahead of meeting-prep.

Both checks run over EVERY skill in the repo, so a skill PR is covered without
its author writing any Python. MESSAGES is kept by reviewers: when a skill
lands, add a few messages it should answer.
