# Upgrade this VM to the newest commit on main once CI has passed on it. Run
# by waku-autodeploy.timer every five minutes; off until an operator runs
# `autodeploy.sh --enable` once.
#
# usage: autodeploy.sh             one tick: decide, deploy at most one commit
#        autodeploy.sh --enable    install and start the timer
#        autodeploy.sh --disable   stop the timer
#        autodeploy.sh --status    what is deployed, what failed, whether paused
#
# ONE TICK, IN ORDER, and every step that says no exits before the next:
#
#   1. the kill switch file exists           -> log "paused", exit 0
#   2. another upgrade holds the lock        -> log, exit 0
#   3. git ls-remote reads main's SHA, ONCE. That SHA, not a branch name, is
#      what gets deployed: passing origin/main to upgrade.sh would deploy
#      whatever landed between the check and the fetch
#   4. main equals the last deployed SHA, or is in the failed list -> exit 0
#   5. main does not descend from the last deployed SHA -> refuse, record it.
#      A force-push or a rewritten history is an operator's call, never the
#      timer's
#   6. every required check passed on that exact SHA (GitHub's public API, no
#      token). Pending or missing -> exit 0 and look again next tick. Failed
#      or cancelled -> record it and never look again
#   7. the commit carries GitHub's own verified signature, which a squash-merge
#      made in the GitHub UI always does -> otherwise refuse, record it
#   8. write run/deploy/releases/<sha>.json: the commit, the time, and each
#      required check's result, link and test counts, for the Evals page.
#      Never a reason to stop: a deploy without a record still deploys
#   9. upgrade.sh --ref <sha>, then the gateway directly AND https://<domain>/login
#      must both answer 200
#  10. on any failure, upgrade.sh --ref <last deployed>, the same two checks,
#      and the SHA joins the failed list. If THAT fails too, this script writes
#      the kill switch itself: a timer that rebuilt a broken VM every five
#      minutes would make the outage harder to read, not shorter
#
# THE LAST DEPLOYED SHA IS A FILE, NOT HEAD. upgrade.sh moves the checkout
# before it builds anything, so after a failed build HEAD is the new commit
# while the old images still serve. A script that compared main with HEAD
# would decide it was up to date and never retry, or never roll back.
#
# THIS SCRIPT LIVES IN THE CHECKOUT IT MOVES. Everything runs inside main(),
# which bash reads whole before running it, so upgrade.sh rewriting this file
# mid-tick cannot change what the running tick does. The rollback runs the
# upgrade.sh of the commit that failed; if that file is what broke, the
# rollback fails and the kill switch stops the timer, which is the safe end.
#
# AN UPGRADE CAN CUT OFF A CHAT TURN IN PROGRESS. upgrade.sh recreates the
# gateway when its image changed, and every turn streams through it. Waiting
# for idle tenants is deliberately not in this version.
