"""Consolidation — distilling chats into durable memory, but only sometimes.

The whiteboard's diamond: "only consolidate after N new chats". Running a
summarizer after every message is wasteful and noisy; batching N exchanges
gives the summarizer enough context to extract facts worth keeping.

A cheap model reads the unconsolidated chat log and produces:
  - facts   → semantic memory ("Alex prefers morning meetings")
  - episode → episodic memory ("2026-07-10: planned the Acme demo with Alex")

Spec 006: with Waku Memory connected, every fact it keeps is also sent there
through `remember`, a callable app.py builds from the MCP connection. This
module never sees the transport, so a fake stands in for it in the evals.

Spec 009 B: when the exchanges saved a research report, the report holds the
findings. Consolidation then keeps at most two facts, about the user or their
decisions, and drops any fact whose subject the report is about.

A turn that answered from memory it read (a recall turn) passes that memory
as `recalled`. The answer repeats it, so the summariser would extract it
again and Waku Memory would get a second copy of every finding (2026-10-05:
one "what did we find on Mem0's competitors?" kept five). A proposed fact
whose every name, number and date already appears in what the turn read is
dropped (`restates`). Something new the user says has a name or a number
the memory does not, so it is kept.
